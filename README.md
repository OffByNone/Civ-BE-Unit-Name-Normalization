# Civ-BE-Unit-Name-Normalization
Normalizes the names in Civilization Beyond Earth so it is easier to understand.

I used the normalize.js to normalize the names.  I then replaced the normalized names with their corresponding names from CivBEGameTextInfos_Units.xml.

For the expansion I only ran lines 13-214 through normalize.js
